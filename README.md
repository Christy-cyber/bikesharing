# NYC Citibike Challenge
## Overview and Purpose
Citibike rideshare data for August 2019 in New York City were analyzed in order to determine trends in bike usage across the city.  These findings will provide information for investors who may wish to fund a similar bikeshare program in Des Moines, Iowa. In addition to visualizations created for number of rides, customer type, peak hours, top starting and ending locations, gender breakdown, average trip duration, bike repairs, and bike utilization, the following deliverables were requested:
  - Checkout times for users
  - Checkout times for gender
  - Number of bike trips per hour
  - Number of bike trips by gender (weekday per hour)
  - User type (customer vs. subscriber) trips by gender by weekday

## Resources
- Data Source: 201908-citibike-tripdata.csv (downloaded from https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html on 18 March 2022)
- Software: Tableau Desktop Public Edition v. 2021.4.4; Jupyter Notebook v. 6.4.6

Tableau was used to create all charts and graphs.

Jupyter notebook was used to convert data from an integer to a datetime datatype in the "tripduration" column from the original Excel spreadsheet.  All other column data remained the same.  The new spreadsheet, which contained the datetime datatype for "tripduration," was named "citibike-trips.csv" and was used in these analyses.
